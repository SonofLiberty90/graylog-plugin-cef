# Graylog CEF message input

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Graylog2/graylog-plugin-cef.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Graylog2/graylog-plugin-cef)

Graylog input plugin to receive CEF logs via UDP or TCP. Install the plugin and launch a new CEF input from `System -> Inputs` in your Graylog Web Interface.

This plugin is strictly following the CEF standard and will probably not work with non-compliant messages. Please open an issue in this repository in case of any problems.
